# GTK and Python for Windows

This project builds the Python and GTK framework for BleachBit
to use on Microsoft Windows. This includes introspection support
and a PyGObject wheel. We use Microsoft Visual C++ and vcpkg instead
of gcc and msys2.

As of 2025-02-14, this project builds
* Python 3.11.10
* GTK 3.24.43
* PyGObject 3.51.0

The build environment is GitHub Actions with MSVC++ 2022.
For more information about the build environment and build
process, see the [GitHub Action YAML files](https://github.com/bleachbit/pygtkwin/tree/main/.github/workflows)
or [logs](https://github.com/bleachbit/pygtkwin/actions).

If you need to run GTK on Windows, try this repository
plus the [install script](https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit/blob/master/windows/python-gtk3-install.ps1)
from the BleachBit repository.
